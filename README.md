# Custom Shop

Fill your own shop with products as a registered admin, add to cart, order and pay them through Stripe's test payment method with a fake card number (e.g. 4242 4242 4242 4242), then get your invoice from orders tab.

## Usage

Use the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager.

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm start
```
